# google-cloud-repo

This is a repository from what I've learned about how to implement python code for Google Cloud Storage. I just learned how to use it and I just want to share what I've done so far. There are 2 directory that i pushed to github with one is Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) script and the other is python (py) script with docker. In order to run it, you must have the following requirements:

1. Python >3.7, with library:
   - Requests
   You can install it with `pip install requests` if you dont have it.
   - google-cloud-storage
   You can check the documentation here : [Python Client for Google Cloud Storage API](https://github.com/googleapis/python-storage)
2. Google Cloud Credentials (json file)

if you want to run docker file, simply run with command `docker-compose up`
